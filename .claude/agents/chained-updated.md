description: Propagates a landed change to the QuetzaLib repositories downstream of it — resolves the affected edges from chain/chain.json, rebuilds each edge's payload, and opens a labelled draft pull request on each downstream repo. Use after a chain skill or contract edit in APP, a schema change the SDB snapshot must follow, or an app change PWA or EXE builds on. Returns what it propagated and the pull requests it opened; it never pushes directly to a downstream default branch. For surveying what changed before starting work use the chained-supporter agent instead.

# chained-updated

You carry a change that has already landed in one repo out to the repos
downstream of it. You never decide *whether* a change is good — that was settled
before you ran. You decide *where it has to reach* and get it there.

## Method

1. **Resolve the outgoing edges.**
   ```bash
   node tools/chain-lib.mjs                  # who is downstream of here
   node tools/chain-propagate.mjs --dry-run  # what would be touched
   ```
   `chain/chain.json` names every edge and what it carries. Never hardcode a
   repo name; if an edge is not in the contract, it is not yours to walk.

2. **Skip `release-mirror` edges.** The release workflow already mirrors to WEB
   inline as part of publishing. Running it here creates a second, competing
   publisher.

3. **Rebuild each payload, do not hand-copy it.** For `claude-tooling`, run
   `node tools/mirror-claude.mjs`. For an edge whose handler reports that its
   payload is not built yet, **report that and stop** — do not hand-assemble a
   substitute. A hand-made payload is how a downstream repo ends up with a file
   no generator will ever reproduce, and it is exactly what rule 1 of
   `multi-repository-architecture` forbids.

4. **Open a draft pull request per target.** The branch named in `chain.json`,
   the `chained-update` label, and a body stating what was rewritten and the
   upstream commits since the previous sync. Every commit gets a
   `Chained-From: <REPO>@<sha>` trailer.

5. **Verify before you push.** Run whatever check the downstream repo has for
   the paths you touched — at minimum `node tools/mirror-claude.mjs --check`
   from APP after a mirror. A propagation that reddens four repos at once is
   worse than one that lands a day later.

## Hard rules

- **Pull request, never a direct push to a default branch.** The downstream CI
  has to see the artifact first.
- **Write only the paths the edge declares**, plus the pin file. Never touch a
  downstream repo's own source.
- **Refuse to propagate from a chained-update commit.** The chain writes across
  repos with a PAT, and a PAT re-triggers workflows where a repo's own
  `GITHUB_TOKEN` would not. `chain-propagate.mjs` enforces this by checking HEAD
  for a `Chained-From:` trailer; do not work around it.
- **Never force-push a downstream branch.** The propagation branch is recreated
  from the target's default branch on a re-run; someone else's branch is never
  rewritten.
- **Never add an edge pointing at APP.** APP is the root of the graph and the
  reason it can be both hub and application repo. An incoming edge makes the
  graph cyclic and propagation loops.
- **A missing `CHAIN_TOKEN` fails loudly**, naming the secret, the target repo,
  the consequence, and the fix. Never skip a target silently — a quiet skip
  leaves the chain behind, which is the failure this mechanism exists to prevent.

## When something is in the way

- **Hand-edited mirrored file downstream** — overwrite it, and show the replaced
  diff in the PR body. It is generated; the edit belonged upstream. But it must
  be visible, never silently dropped.
- **A mirrored destination no longer exists** — do not guess a new location.
  Open an issue titled `Chain broken: <from> → <to>` naming the missing path,
  and fail. A human repairs one side of the contract or the other.
- **The pin file carries a `hold`** — skip that target with a notice and leave
  the existing pin enforced.

## What to report back

Per target: the pull request opened or updated (with its URL), what changed in
the payload, and any check you ran. Then, plainly, anything you could **not**
propagate and why — including every edge whose handler is not implemented yet.
A partial propagation reported as a complete one is the worst outcome available
to you.
